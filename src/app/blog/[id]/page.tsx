    content: `When it comes to jewellery, you'll often want to make it your focus. A show-stopper piece will want to be a specific style that you want others to be drawn to when they look at you. Particularly for me, this is a way of communicating something about yourself to other people, so it pays to spend some time choosing about it.If you want the focus to be on your earrings, considering wearing a very subtle necklace - or don't wear a necklace at all and go for delicate bracelets and rings. If the focal point will be your necklace, then wear small earrings and delicate rings.
Likewise, you'll want to avoid too many other accessories when you are wearing jewellery or wear more simple jewellery if you want to show off an accessory instead. If a beautiful scarf is the thing you want people to focus on, then consider subtle gold earrings and rings.
Finally, our favourite tip is to experiment with bending and breaking the rules. If you don't want to have a single focal point, then consider wearing a suite of jewellery that works beautifully together overall, perhaps because it's based on a colour, theme, repetition of design or general aesthetic.
For instance, choosing all gold jewellery with the same or similar coloured gemstones appearing in rings, earrings and necklaces can work beautifully, especially if you co-ordinate your clothing. Imagine a bright, colour-blocked dress paired with such a collection of jewellery.
    A common mistake people make is either wearing too much jewellery in an unbalanced way or wearing other jewellery that directly competes with the main piece of jewellery they want to be the focus.
    For example, if you're trying to show off a beautiful gold necklace, wearing much more in your earrings than your necklace, even if they don't, the earrings will still be a distraction, instead of being complementary to your necklace. The same goes for rings - if you want one to stand out and lead the rest of your jewellery styling choices.`,
  
  
    additionalContent: `Match Gold Jewellery With Your Outfit.
        Yes, gold jewellery is beautiful, but that does not necessarily mean it will work with every outfit you own. You should always consider jewellery as being part of your wardrobe and think about how it will work with what clothing you're planning on wearing and the other accessories you might choose. In particular, have a think about which colours will work with your gold jewellery. Wearing clothing with dark yellow, golden, orange or even red tones may cause it to get lost, for instance. Wearing it with neon colours is unlikely to work, but if you can pull it off, then good for you!
        Mixing silver and gold used to be seen as a fashion faux pas. The excellent news is that those days are gone and you should feel free to mix your metals with abandon.
        Real gold is a very expensive metal, so having smaller solid gold highlights paired with silver is a beautiful way to include the colours of gold and rose gold without needing to go all out investing in all gold jewellery. It's also just more fun and much more creative, so why not break the old fashion rules and experiment?
        You could wear individual pieces which are designed to include both metals, which is something we do a lot of at Simone Walsh Jewellery. Alternatively wear small gold earrings or skinny gold rings with other jewellery pieces in silver.

If environmental issues, sustainability and ethics are important to you (and I hope they are), then do your research. Greenwashing is absolutely a thing.
Does the business give you their back story? Does it sound genuine or like it's just marketing fluff? Do they explain what they do to be more ethical and sustainable in their business? Is it plausible? Are you clear on the materials they're using? Or how they make or source their pieces?
Spending a little bit of time getting a gut feeling for a brand before spending your money with them can make a big difference.
I hope this article goes some way to dispelling some jewellery myths and helping you avoid being conned by misleading marketing. For more helpful hints when shopping for jewellery, check out these handy articles:
10 Tips for Safely Buying Jewellery in Australia
Jewellery Mistakes We Wish You'd Stop Making Online Jewellery Shopping Mistakes to Avoid.
Even highly corrosion resistant metals like stainless steel and titanium can be affected by chemicals found in some water and from long periods of water immersion, so it's still recommended that you remove such jewellery while showering and if you go swimming regularly.
Gemstone Jewellery
If you have gemstone jewellery, then this is also something to consider when it comes to water. Softer gems like opal and also pearls can be affected by exposure to water. Do your research before getting gemstone jewellery wet on a regular basis.
PVD Coating
On the upside, there is PVD coating (physical vapour deposition) which bonds a strong coating material to metal jewellery. This does provide good protection from water damage and makes jewellery tarnish resistant. Some brands advertising waterproof jewellery are indeed using PVD coatings, so their claims are more valid.
This is still far from a perfect solution, however. While PVD coating is durable, it will be difficult to repair or replace when it wears through, which it will almost certainly do eventually - and faster for designs that take a lot of wear and tear (rings and bracelets especially). It's also an expensive process, so there will be a limited array of generally mass produced designs which make use of it and it will noticeably increase the price of those designs. Another issue is that if the piece needs to be repaired, resized or you want it redesigned, the coating may cause problems.
It's up to you to decide whether it's worth it, especially if the underlying metal isn't precious (most PVD coated jewellery I've encountered isn't made of solid precious metal) and the piece has minimal intrinsic value.
The bottom line
All metals and some gemstones will be somewhat affected by prolonged exposure to water or moisture, which can lead to corrosion, pitting or other damage.
If you see metal jewellery advertised as being waterproof, then be sure to look into what backs up this claim. While there are some ways of making metals more resistant to water damage, you should check what specific method is being used (if any), along with what the pros and cons might be.`,
   

additionalContent: `Sweatproof Jewellery
PVD Coating
As outlined in the waterproof jewellery section above, there is PVD coating (physical vapour deposition) which will also make jewellery tarnish resistant and is likely to last longer than plating. But, while it is durable, it can wear through and will be difficult to repair or replace.
It also increases cost and only a limited number of designs will have it, with many of them not being made of precious metal.
If you want jewellery that generally won't tarnish, then it's worth investing in solid gold jewellery (14k and up) or going for platinum, stainless steel or titanium. Note that white gold is usually also rhodium plated to make it a truly white colour, so it will have the same problem with wearing through and needing repair.
If you're seeing silver jewellery being marketed as tarnish free, once again you need to look into on what basis this claim is being made. Also consider the pros and cons of coatings or metals that are less prone to tarnish. And make sure you're across what tarnish is and how to avoid it and clean it.
Ethical & Sustainable Jewellery,
I'm increasingly seeing jewellery brands advertising that they're sustainable, ethical and environmentally friendly. A number of them are clearly making genuine efforts in these areas, which is great.
This marketing term is just as problematic as waterproof jewellery and for many of the same reasons.
Sweat is slightly acidic and often contains salts, which can damage metal jewellery, including causing pitting and increased tarnish. Sweat also contains a myriad of other substances which can cause damage or simply leave a residue on your jewellery which will need cleaning. Sweat may also damage or discolour some gemstones, especially pearls.
In addition, some people's sweat contains a mixture of chemicals that simply don't play well with some metals (silver in particular). If you're one of these people, you need to be careful about the metals you choose to wear.
There are platings and coatings (including PVD, as above, and rhodium plating on silver or white gold) which may provide resistance to sweat, but many of these will eventually wear through and need repair or replacement, which may be expensive or problematic.
The Bottom Line
Given you'll want to clean your jewellery anyway if it has been caked in residue from sweat, then there doesn't seem to be a lot of point in seeking 'sweatproof' jewellery. It's another marketing term to be wary of and to look into when you see it.
My advice is to take your jewellery off if you know you're going to be sweating a lot (during exercise for instance, and especially if you exercise regularly). Also be sure to give your jewellery a clean with a gentle soap and some water if you've been sweating on it. Check out our article about how to quickly clean jewellery.
Hypoallergenic Jewellery
Did you know that 'hypoallergenic' is just a marketing term which was coined in the 1950s? There is no regulatory basis for use of it in Australia, the United States or elsewhere. In theory it's intended to indicate a lower risk from allergic reactions to a particular product, but nobody ensures that this is how the term is used. In fact research indicates that many products which claim to be hypoallergenic actually contain known allergens.
The use of the term 'hypoallergenic' in jewellery marketing is also frequently misleading and you should be wary when you come across it. It is often based on misunderstandings or lack of research.`,

We love a good special occasion outfit planning sesh, and of course jewellery is an essential component to complement, elevate and bring everything together. Plus, you get to look at soooo many pretty things. And don’t worry – many of these online stores (including ours) provide payment options so if you see something you love you can pay for it incrementally, and with options that shouldn't break your budget.
ushing around a lot this time of year can take a toll on one’s hair. No time to sit in front of a dryer or muck about with styling? Why not hide the damage under something that is already gorgeously put together?
We recommend getting your hair issues sorted in an instant by wrapping it up in one of Julie White's silk scarves. Each scarf features a colourful contemporary Australiana print, which works beautifully with some of our Australian floral pieces. While we can’t decide on our favourite design, we reckon they’d all be complemented by our Flora Dish Pendant Necklace.
You could wrap (GET IT) your headscarf-based ensemble up with some glorious Eucalyptus Flower Dangle Earrings and turn yourself into a walking garden of Australian blooms.
Plus, if there's a change in the weather or bees try to pollenate you, you can unwrap your hair and drape the scarf around you, just like a flowy, protective cardigan.

   Based in the town formally known as Brisbane, the Alice Nightingale team exclusively select secondhand, vintage and locally produced fabrics to make small run pieces. Environmentally sound, small runs mean you'll be infinitely less likely to run into anyone else wearing your outfit, that you chose, with your exquisite and individual taste. So rude when that happens. Copiers. Should be illegal.
Expertly spanning the barbecue or formal lunch event spectrum, the blues and ace detailing on this flowy playsuit would be nicely finished by adding our Ocean Textures Sodalite Beaded Necklace. The necklace itself is inspired by coral, sand, seagrass, dotted rocks and sea urchins. You could round the whole outfit out with a Montana Sapphire & Solid Gold Stacking Ring or Stacking Rings Set: Sapphire & Aquamarine to keep
We're also pretty keen to add Alice's Dog Button Up Shirt to basket to have a complete parent/fur child complementary concept, just quietly. What's a festive season without our furry mates?

The neon joy of Khòlò's Black Rodeo print screams festive good times, orrrrr staying at home and feeling good about your life choices; your call. The print comes in four different designs including a reversible skirt, with options to fill up any black holes in your wardrobe. With pockets of course.

These pieces would all look amazing with our Stars & Sapphires Cluster Necklace with sapphires that graduate from palest to darkest blue. For a subtle pop of even more colour (because who can get enough – not us) we’d add the vibrantly elegant blue Sapphire & Solid Gold Stud Earrings. You could go full star that you are by adding any of our star-based designs to build a magnificent force field against negativity. Sparrrrrkly.

Let's dive in ...
What does she wear?
If possible (and without being creepy, of course) try to sneak a look at her jewellery collection when she's not around to see what she has in her stash. This is a great way to get an idea of what she likes to wear.
Ask yourself some questions about what you see:
Are her jewellery pieces generally small and subtle? Or larger and intended to be eye-catching?
Does she prefer silver jewellery or gold jewellery? Or a mixture?
Do you see her wearing coloured jewellery or just plain metal jewellery pieces?
If her jewellery is colourful, is there a dominant colour or type?
Is there a colour or type of gemstone jewellery she favours?
Does she have a preferred design theme, for example: flowers, geometric designs, minimalist forms, hearts or flourishes?
Do you think she has a preference for wearing a particular type of jewellery: necklaces, earrings or rings?
What specific styles of jewellery does she favour: dangle earrings or stud earrings, chain necklaces or necklaces with pendants, simple stacking rings or bigger cocktail rings?`,


    additionalContent: `What type of person is she?
    You'll also find it helpful just to think about the type of person she is when you're choosing a gift:
Is she unlikely to buy anything special for herself? Can you make up for this?
Is she outgoing and enjoys attention, or the opposite?
Is she sentimental and does she like sentimental gifts, such as birthstone jewellery or other meaningful jewellery pieces?
Does she like dressing up to go out?
Would she enjoy a piece of bolder statement jewellery to wear for special occasions?
Another thing to consider is what activities your gift recipient does day-to-day:
Does she work in a job where she needs to look smart or more casual?
Is she able to wear jewellery day-in, day-out, or only when going out socially?
How often does she go out? Special occasions only or more regularly?
Does she have small children which might make regularly wearing long necklaces or dangly earrings difficult?
Are there any special occasions coming up which she's likely to dress up for?
Does she like to wear everyday jewellery and could do with more variety in her wardrobe basics?
Once you've chosen the perfect gift, don't forget those finishing touches that really do make a difference.
Get a gift card to go with the gift and write a heartfelt message on it. Sometimes a meaningful gift card can be the best part of receiving a present from someone special.
Also don't forget gift wrapping. Unwrapping a gift is a ritual that people love and it shows you've gone to extra effort to treat them. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, but do put a little bit of work into make your gift that bit more special and exciting.

    A well-made piece of jewellery from a loved one can be a gift we wear every day, with emotional ties to the person from whom it came. Many are lucky enough to have pieces that have been passed down through generations. The right piece can pick us up when we’re down or can work like a protective shield; as though we carry our loved ones with us.
This year for Christmas we recommend making it meaningful; chose a gift that has a lot of thought behind it. Here are some choices we’ve put together, including pieces from our latest Australian Flora Range, inspired by stunning native flowers and plants.
Don't forget that it doesn't have to be Christmas to give meaningful gifts, so these suggestions will work all year around. Read on ...
Wattle it be?
The popular golden wattle has been a marker of seasonal change in Australia for tens of thousands of years. First Nations people have utilised the wattle tree and flowers not only as an indicator of seasonal change, but also as a source of food, medicine and raw materials for making musical or hunting implements. As a species the tree has been part of the Australian landscape for 35 million years, with the golden wattle featuring on our Coat of Arms and as our official national flower. It’s a pretty big deal.
Being quintessentially Australian, and growing in pretty much every state, the wattle has also been used as a symbol of national solidarity in times of crisis. It’s a familiar spring sight, one that evokes joy with glorious golden flowers, which Simone has used in her new collection.
A wattle necklace or gold signet ring with a wattle motif as a present could signify the promise that positive change is afoot, or to symbolise standing in solidarity with a friend or loved one. They’re also a great choice for those of us who wish to embrace the wattle but are generally too allergic to enjoy spring (not the wattle’s fault mind).
Don't settle petal
Part of the citrus family, the boronia shrub exists in all states of Australia and is part of a whopping 160 species of flowering plants. The boronia flower generally has four separate open petals, which are thought to signify a connection between all things.
The open nature of the flower is thought to expand the heart, vision and self-awareness, while also bringing laughter and joy. The flower itself a has a strong, sweet-scented smell which is used in perfume production or in floristry. It may even remind you of someone you know.
The boronia and pink tourmaline necklace, we believe, would suit a young relative about to make their way out into the world, with the flower reminding them of home and to keep an open heart, to trust themselves and to take joy in their first big adventure. Also take a look at the sweet and simple matching pink tourmaline and gold stud earrings.
For that person who brings joy into your life
Daisies are not just a pretty face; they also provide a valuable food source for bees, flowering all year ‘round. They signify friendship and warmth, making them perfect for that friend who always picks you up when you’re feeling down.
Opals are thought to amplify your thoughts and put them through the wash, bringing clarity and energy. They also have the advantage of changing colour, depending on the light, making them versatile.
This daisy and opal ring and matching daisy necklace work together beautifully and are two customer faves. We love them as they replicate that glow and joy one feels when meeting up with someone precious to us. Plus, the lucky recipient can mix and match the ring with others in our range or their own collection. `,

Moonshine
There’s always that one person you ‘love to the moon and back’, say your Nan, bestie or a beloved pet. As part of our amulets range, this Victorian-style moon and back locket in silver is a great gift for the person that fills that sentiment.
The locket has a small space to hold a picture or even a small personal artefact like a pet’s discarded whisker. It’s a good every day wear piece as it goes with pretty much everything. The gemstone is a luminous white moonstone, to light your way back to the one you love.
Looking for something simpler with the same sentiment? Take a look at our little moon and stars silver pendant, featuring a tiny marcasite gem.
Also see our Amulets Range, which includes many other jewellery designs inspired by wishes for good luck, protection and love, pretty much covering all the bases for a person close to your heart.
To protect your lucky charms
Many cultures believe a person can use the power of the eye to convey a curse onto an enemy, targeting them with bad luck and physical/psychic harm. The power of the evil eye, or Mati, dates as far back as 6th century Greece. Fortunately, the eye amulet was designed to protect its wearer from such things, helping dispel any curses and looking very stylish as it does so.
Our plain silver eye amulet necklace is discrete so they’ll never see you coming. It’s part of our wider Amulets Range, which features different jewels and formats, including the solid gold eye amulet necklace with tsavorite gem for a bolder version of this necklace.
Whichever style you choose, an amulet is an ideal gift for someone who’s been going through a rough time. Even if they don’t believe in curses, they’ll be sure that you are keeping an eye out for them every day.
No matter what pieces you choose, our diverse ranges will likely feature a piece that your friends or loved one swill treasure forever. You know them best after all.

If you're not sure where to start, don't worry: in this article, we'll give you some quick and informative tips on how to style and care for your silver jewellery, so you can look and feel your best every day.
Why Silver Jewellery?
Silver jewellery is ideal for women who want to elevate their look and express their creativity with unique designs that have the classic cool colouring of silver.
As women age, their tastes and preferences change. They want something that is stylish, elegant while also being unique and high quality. That's why silver jewellery is the perfect choice given the wide array of designs made in silver.

With its cool and shiny finish, genuine silver jewellery will bring a touch of glamour to any outfit.

Best of all, silver jewellery is a timeless choice that will never go out of style. You can wear it for years to come, making it a great investment for your wardrobe.
Styling Silver Jewellery
Styling silver jewellery well requires some creativity, confidence and a little bit of know-how. Whether you're new to styling jewellery or a seasoned pro, these style tips will help you create the perfect look with your silver jewellery.
Consider the Occasion
When it comes to styling silver jewellery, the first thing to consider is the occasion. Different occasions call for different types of jewellery. For example, you might wear a delicate silver necklace for a casual lunch date, but opt for a bold statement pendant necklace for a special event.
Layer Your Jewellery
One of the best ways to create a statement look with your silver jewellery is by layering it. Start with a simple silver chain necklace and add a few other pieces to create a unique and eye-catching look. Experiment with different lengths and styles to find what works best for you.
Mix and Match Metals
Don't be afraid to mix and match different metals when mixing jewellery. Silver jewellery looks great when paired with gold or rose gold. Mixing metals can add depth and texture to your look and create a unique and personalised style `,

    Experiment with Different Styles
Don't be afraid to experiment with different styles when wearing jewellery. Try pairing delicate silver jewellery with a boho-inspired outfit, or wear a bold silver necklace with a classic little black dress. Mixing different styles can create a unique and personalised look that is all your own.
Play with Texture
When styling silver jewellery, playing with texture can add interest and depth to your look. Consider pairing a smooth, polished silver ring with a hammered silver bracelet, or mixing a delicate silver necklace with a chunky, textured silver cuff. By mixing different textures, you can create a unique and personalised style that is sure to turn heads.
Skin Tone Considerations
For a long time silver jewellery was thought to be best paired with cool-toned skin, while warm-toned skin was thought to work better with gold or copper coloured jewellery. These days that fashion 'rule' is no longer considered to be all that important. We recommend that you experiment with different colours and finishes to find what works best for you. You might be surprised!

    Like so many other products, jewellery sales are increasingly moving online rather than taking place in a traditional brick and mortar store. Shopping online is of course quick and convenient, plus it allows you to shop from places far away from your location.
While being able to see a piece of jewellery and trying it on in person is great, the downside is the inconvenience of needing to travel to a store and being limited to what that particular store has available. You'll also miss out on beautiful artisan jewellery created by independent designers who generally don't have bricks and mortar stores (like us!).
While there are plenty of upsides to shopping for jewellery online, you do need to take care and pay attention to the right things to avoid some of the pitfalls. Even if you feel like a seasoned pro when buying jewellery online, it's still a great idea to have a refresher when it comes to what to be wary of.
If you avoid our top 7 Online Jewellery Shopping Mistakes, you'll be much more likely to have a positive experience and will enjoy wearing your beautiful new pieces for years to come.
Let's get started 
Skimming the Description & Photos
In an ideal world, there are some things you'd prefer to see and feel in person before buying them. Jewellery is likely to be one of them as it's good to be able to try it on and decide if it feels right. Of course that isn't possible when shopping online.
A new online jewellery shopper may be concerned about missing out on the 'trying on' step of the purchasing process, but that's where detailed descriptions can help you.
If you're shopping with a well run and reputable online jewellery store the product listings will have in-depth information and observations about each piece of jewellery. You'll get a very good idea of what to expect just from reading this information. In particular the description should give you a clear information about the materials used to make the piece (if not, this is a red flag for jewellery shopping) and the dimensions.
Also check all of the photos provided by the online store to see the piece from different angles and to get an even better idea of size.
Too many shoppers don't read the descriptions thoroughly or look through all of the photographs. They miss out on crucial details that could sway their decision. It's definitely a mistake to avoid.
 Not Checking the Returns Policy
sn't the right thing when it arrives. Often that's the point at which we'll check the returns policy for the first time. Sometimes we'll be disappointed to discover that a return either isn't straightforward or isn't possible at all.
A good online store should provide its customers with a fair returns policy, particularly when it comes to items like jewellery where seeing a piece in person is very important. At Simone Walsh Jewellery we have a money back 'happiness guarantee' that allows returns for any reason.
The best time to check the returns policy is before you buy. That way you'll know where you stand up front when it comes to returns or exchanges. You should feel confident before making a purchase that you can resolve the issue if your item arrives and it isn't suitable.
Not reading the returns policy before you shop online is a mistake that's easy to avoid once you get into the habit.  `,

     Shopping with Fake Businesses
Unfortunately, one of the biggest downsides of shopping online is an abundance of scams and fake businesses designed to trick you out of your money. The good news is that there are a number of clues to look for and some tools you can use to help you feel confident about who you're shopping with.
As an example, lately we've been seeing online stores advertised on Facebook with a vast array of highly varied designs and surprisingly low prices (both are a clue that something isn't right), along with a sad story about how they're closing down. When we look closely at one of these online stores, we'll discover it was only created in the past few weeks or months. At best you'll get some poor quality jewellery that doesn't resemble the photos, but at worst you'll get nothing at all for your money.
One of the most important things you can do is practice safe online shopping habits and do your research before making any purchases.
A good tip for the 'closing down' scam outlined above is to check the domain name for the online store to see its history. Here is the Who.Is entry for simonewalsh.com, which shows our domain name has been registered since 2000. The Way Back Machine is also a great resource. Looking up our site there will tell you that we've had an online presence since at least 2004. Another good place to check is Scam Advisor, where we get a trust score of 100/100.
There are a variety of other ways to verify if a business is legitimate or not and it's worth the effort to do those things. A little bit of extra research time can save you a lot of money and hassle in the long run.
It's a good idea to look for online customer reviews about the item you're thinking about or the company itself, especially if you're shopping with a business you haven't dealt with before.
These reviews can give you a  first-hand account of the quality of the product, the shipping process and how the company handles various issues. You can find a lot of relevant and helpful information in these reviews. It's a good way to help you feel confident in your purchase.
If you're shopping with a small business you might find they have a lot fewer reviews online than big box stores. That's not necessarily a sign that anything is wrong. Customers are more likely to spend time to leave poor reviews for bad products or customer service, so a lack of reviews likely indicates there have been few problems if the business is well established.
If you do see bad reviews for a business, look for a pattern rather than taking a single bad review to heart. Sometimes people can be malicious for no good reason.
Online Jewellery Shopping Mistakes to Avoid
Jewellery is often the key piece in an outfit that pulls it all together or it can be a sentimental piece that brings back special memories. You might choose a piece of jewellery for yourself purely based on aesthetics or because it has a deeper meaning for you and says something about who you are. Either way, you want to be sure that you're choosing just the right pieces for yourself (or your gift recipient).

Taking a little extra time and care to avoid these online jewellery shopping mistakes can help you find just the thing. Online jewellery shops open a whole new world of possibilities and options for you to choose from as you build your collection. A few new pieces can level up your whole style instantly.

    title: "Modern Gold Jewellery Trends",
    subtitle: "Stay updated with the latest trends in modern gold jewellery.",

    Gold rings have been a much sought after jewellery accessory for millennia, with some of the oldest rings in gold found to date having been made around 6,500 years ago. The beauty, elegance, preciousness and durability of solid gold has made it an enormously popular choice for rings, right up to the present day.
Of course gold rings (as with all solid gold jewellery) are expensive, so why do people invest in them rather than more affordable metals?
Read on to explore the benefits of owning and wearing solid gold jewellery, along with the versatility and timeless style of gold rings and the different types of gold rings that you could consider adding to your rings collection.
Benefits of Solid Gold Rings:
Solid gold jewellery is known for its durability and strength, making it perfect for everyday wear. Rings can take a bit of a beating, especially if you wear them a lot of the time, so having them made in solid gold means they will survive the wear and tear of life better than softer metals, such as silver.
Unlike other metals, solid gold in 14ct (14K) or above does not tarnish or corrode, which means it will always maintain its stunning shine and beauty. It can sometimes discolour due to exposure chemicals including make up and chlorine. Read our article about how to care for and clean jewellery for some tips about this.
Although a tiny number of people are thought to have an allergy to it, gold is also generally non-irritating for almost everyone, making it a great choice for sensitive skin types. However, be aware that gold which is alloyed with nickel is much more prone to triggering allergies, so take care to choose jewellery which is nickel free (as is all Simone Walsh Jewellery). If you've read that gold is 'hypoallergenic', then be aware that this is just a marketing term: learn more in our jewellery myths article.
Finally, solid gold will generally retain its value as a precious metal and it can be endlessly reused when melted down. One of the reason gold has historically been used for wedding rings is as a demonstration of the groom's ability to provide for his bride, but also to give something small, portable and high value which can be sold in desperate times.
Versatility of Rings in Gold:
Being such a classic metal, gold rings are one of the most versatile pieces of jewellery a woman can own. Depending on the design, they can be worn with any outfit, from casual to formal and they will dress up or down really well.
They are generally ideal for everyday wear given how hard wearing they tend to be (again, depending on the design).
Rings in gold also come in a variety of styles, including classic designs, modern and contemporary designs, and even bohemian and vintage designs.
The timeless style of gold rings makes them a great investment. Unlike fashion jewellery pieces that come and go, gold rings will never go out of style. They can be passed down from generation to generation, and will always be a valuable piece of jewellery to have in your collection.
Additionally, if you do decide you no longer like a particular design or need it to be modified in some way, a manufacturing jeweller can potentially modify or remake a gold ring for you. Plus of course they are generally repairable should something go wrong.

Opal is a unique and fascinating gemstone that has been used in jewellery for millennia. With its distinctive play of colours and iridescence, opal jewellery is both beautiful and eye-catching. Opals definitely deserve a place in your jewellery collection, but what do you really know about them?
In this article, we'll explore the history of opal jewellery, how opals are formed, and how to care for opal jewellery to ensure that it stays looking beautiful for years to come.
Let's get started ...
How are Opals Formed?
The process begins when silica-rich water seeps down into cracks and crevices in the Earth's crust. Over time, the water evaporates, leaving behind a deposit of silica. As this process repeats, layer upon layer of silica builds up, eventually forming a solid mineral deposit that we know as opal.
The process can take anywhere from 5 million to 20 million years, depending on the specific conditions and factors involved. The result is a unique and beautiful gemstone with a distinct play of colour, created by the way light refracts through the layers of silica.
Not all opals feature the iridescence and play of colour seen particularly in Australian opals, but instead have more of a solid colouring which can be white, yellow, pink, orange, red and even black.
The History of Opal Jewellery
Opals have been used in jewellery for thousands of years, with some of the earliest examples dating back to ancient Greece and Rome. In the Middle Ages, opals were believed to have magical powers, and they were highly prized by royalty and the wealthy.
By the 19th century, opal jewellery was becoming more widely available, and it became a popular choice for engagement rings and other special occasion jewellery.
In the 20th century, opal jewellery became even more popular and today it remains a popular choice for jewellery lovers today. With its unique play of colours and iridescence, opal jewellery is a great way to add some colour and personality to your jewellery collection.
About Australian Opals
Australia is known for producing some of the finest opals in the world, with over 95% of the world's supply of opals coming from the country.
The first opal was discovered in Australia in the 1840s, but it wasn't until the late 1800s that opal mining began in earnest. The first commercial opal mine opened in White Cliffs, New South Wales in 1890, and soon after, other deposits were found in regions such as Coober Pedy, Lightning Ridge and Andamooka.
Opal mining in Australia is still largely a small-scale industry, with many of the mines being family-run operations. However, there are also larger mining companies that employ hundreds of people and produce significant amounts of opal each year. `,

    How to Care for Opal Jewellery
Opals are relatively delicate and require a bit of special care to keep them looking their best. Here are some tips for caring for your opal jewellery:
Opal is quite a soft gemstone, so store your opal jewellery separately from other jewellery to avoid scratches and damage. Soft cloth pouches or jewellery boxes are ideal for storage of precious jewellery.
Clean your opal jewellery regularly to remove dirt and oil buildup. To clean opal jewellery, simply wash it in warm soapy water, rinse and dry thoroughly. Check out our comprehensive jewellery cleaning guide for more tips.
Avoid getting your opal jewellery wet regularly or for extended periods, especially if the opals are doublets or triplets which have artificial backings. We recommend taking it off when showering or swimming. If your opal jewellery gets wet, you should dry it quickly and thoroughly to prevent damage.
For high value opal jewellery, we recommend having your pieces professionally inspected and cleaned periodically to ensure that it stays in top condition.
Avoid exposing opal jewellery to harsh chemicals, such as bleach and cleaning agents, as these can damage the gemstone. Take care if using chemical cleaners on precious metal which has opals set into it: clean around the stones as best you can and be sure to rinse and dry thoroughly when you're done.
Never expose opal jewellery to extreme temperature changes, as this can cause the gemstone to crack or become discoloured. In particular don't use a steam cleaner on opals.

    As sustainability becomes a priority for many, eco-friendly gold jewellery is gaining traction. Traditional gold mining has significant environmental and ethical impacts, including habitat destruction and unfair labor practices. Eco-friendly gold jewellery offers a solution by using recycled gold or ethically sourced materials. This reduces environmental damage and promotes responsible sourcing practices.
    Sustainable gold jewellery brands also focus on transparency, allowing customers to trace the origins of their jewellery. Many artisans are embracing green practices, such as using renewable energy and reducing waste in the manufacturing process. By choosing eco-friendly gold jewellery, you not only enhance your style but also contribute to a healthier planet.
    When shopping for sustainable gold jewellery, look for certifications such as Fairtrade Gold or Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) accreditation. These certifications ensure that your jewellery meets stringent ethical and environmental standards.
    Additionally, sustainable gold jewellery often incorporates innovative designs that reflect the natural beauty of the environment. These unique creations make excellent conversation pieces and demonstrate your commitment to a greener lifestyle. Investing in such jewellery also sends a strong message of support for ethical fashion and mindful consumerism.
    Embracing sustainability in fashion doesn't mean sacrificing quality or beauty. With eco-friendly gold jewellery, you can enjoy timeless designs while aligning your style choices with your values. These pieces make perfect gifts for eco-conscious individuals who appreciate elegance and responsibility. `,

    Caring for Eco-Friendly Gold Jewellery:
    Even sustainable jewellery requires proper care to maintain its beauty and durability. Here are some tips:
    - Store your jewellery in a clean, dry place away from direct sunlight.
    - Use gentle, non-abrasive cleaning products to clean your pieces.
    - Avoid exposing your jewellery to harsh chemicals or perfumes.
    - Handle your jewellery with care to prevent scratches or damage.
    Supporting Ethical Practices:
    By choosing eco-friendly gold jewellery, you are supporting small-scale miners and artisans who adhere to fair trade practices. This contributes to better working conditions and livelihoods for those involved in the supply chain. Look for brands that donate a portion of their profits to environmental or community projects.
    Exploring Alternative Materials:
    Many sustainable jewellery brands are now exploring alternative materials such as lab-grown diamonds and gemstones. These materials are created in controlled environments, ensuring minimal environmental impact. Pairing these with recycled gold further enhances the eco-friendly nature of your jewellery.
    Making a Difference:
    Every small step towards sustainability counts. By opting for eco-friendly gold jewellery, you are taking a significant step towards reducing the environmental footprint of your fashion choices. Share your journey and inspire others to embrace sustainable living.`,
